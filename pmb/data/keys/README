All Alpine Linux keys are stored here, so we can verify the downloaded files with pmbootstrap before APK itself is verified.

Sources for the keys (must be identical, there's a testcase that verifies this):
	https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/tree/master/main/alpine-keys
	http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/tree/main/alpine-keys?h=master
	alpine-keys package

In addition, this key holds keys for the official postmarketOS repository:
	https://build.postmarketos.org
